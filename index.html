				<h2>What is Geyser?</h2>
				<p>Geyser is a proxy, bridging the gap between Minecraft: Bedrock Edition and Minecraft: Java Edition servers. The ultimate goal of this project is to allow Minecraft: Bedrock Edition users to join Minecraft: Java Edition servers as seamlessly as possible to allow for true cross-platform.</p>

					<h2>How does it work?</h2>
					<p>Geyser is a middleware, which translates all the incoming and outgoing packets. With this being said, Geyser works as a standalone proxy, meaning you can use it to join <i>any</i> modern Minecraft Java server. Geyser can also be installed on your server as a plugin, so you can easily make your server compatible with Minecraft: Bedrock Edition.</p>

				<h2>Join from anywhere</h2>
				<p>Geyser can be joined from Windows 10, iOS, Android, and even consoles (see <a href="https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/using-geyser-with-consoles/">here</a> for how to set this up!) Geyser is tested working with a <a href="https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/supported-hosting-providers/">wide array of hosting providers</a>, and, if you own the server, you aren't limited by a Java account with our <a href="https://github.com/GeyserMC/Floodgate/">Floodgate</a> plugin!</p>
